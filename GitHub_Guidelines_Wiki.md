# GitHub Guidelines for CASES Files Organization

This file explains information organization corresponding to the CASES project on GitHub. Please follow below guidelines to upload/commit any file for the project. 

* We will have separate repository corresponding to each CASE file. Please contribute in the existing repository, if any 
  * In case you are creating a new repository, please share with the entire team, Greg and Professor Piety
* Each Repository should have a clear **README** file explaining the objective of the project. 
* While making changes in the existing file, avoid commiting in the main branch. Always, create a new meaningful branch. 
* Upload the Jupyter notebook in the template designed for the project. Since, the team is still working on the template, please upload your own file for now.
